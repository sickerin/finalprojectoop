## Final Project for YSC323

## Contribution guide

The contribution process is...

1. Work on each class/component in your own branch-- never work on an existing class without team's consensus. 
2. Make a PR for your branch
3. Get it code reviewed by someone on the team for major additions/additions with merge conflicts, and address any comments
4. Merge into master (with merge commit)
